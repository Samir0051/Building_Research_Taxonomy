Original Python code used for automatically generating bioinformatic research taxonomies based off of list of papers!

Set-Up Instructions

- Create a directory inlcuding all of the repositories files
- Modify the Paper Keyword Mapping text file to contain the necessary information regarding the papers you want to analyze in the order: year(\tab)title(\tab)keywords(lowercase and separated by commas). In addition, a sample file is included to get an idea of how the information is organized.

- Download the generated html files to analyze data

Notes 
- The script can take a while to run depending on how many papers are being looked at, so it's something to be mindfull of
